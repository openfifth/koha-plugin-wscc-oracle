## CSV File Format

The CSV file uses a single header line with two types of records:

### Header Line (15 fields)

```
INVOICE_NUMBER,INVOICE_TOTAL,INVOICE_DATE,SUPPLIER_NUMBER_PROPERTY_KEY,CONTRACT_NUMBER,SHIPMENT_DATE,LINE_AMOUNT,TAX_AMOUNT,TAX_CODE,DESCRIPTION,COST_CENTRE_PROPERTY_KEY,OBJECTIVE,SUBJECTIVE,SUBANALYSIS,LIN_NUM
```

### Record Types

**Header Records**: Contain invoice-level information in the first 6 fields, with remaining 9 fields empty

- Fields 1-6: Invoice data (number, total, date, supplier, contract, shipment date)
- Fields 7-15: Empty (padded)

**Line Records**: Contain line-level information in fields 7-15, with fields 2-6 empty

- Field 1: Invoice number (links to header)
- Fields 2-6: Empty (padded)
- Fields 7-15: Line data (amount, tax, description, distribution codes)

## Oracle CSV Fields

| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1              | INVOICE_NUMBER                | invoice.invoicenumber       | INV-KOHA-RBKC-31 | Invoice number from Koha                 |
| 2              | INVOICE_TOTAL                 | Calculated from order lines | 5200             | Sum of all line amounts for invoice      |
| 3              | INVOICE_DATE                  | invoice.closedate           | 03/21/2025       | Date invoice was closed in Koha          |
| 4              | SUPPLIER_NUMBER_PROPERTY_KEY  | Fund-based mapping          | 3513             | Mapped from fund code to supplier number |
| 5              | CONTRACT_NUMBER               | Constant                    | C50335           | Fixed contract number                    |
| 6              | SHIPMENT_DATE                 | invoice.shipmentdate        | 03/20/2025       | Date of shipment                         |

#### Koha field mappings

1. Invoice Number = Koha invoicenumber
2. Invoice Total = Sum, in pence, of all line records 'unitprice \* quantity receipted' for the invoice
   _Question_: Should this total be tax inclusive or tax exclusive?
3. Invoice Date = Closed date for invoice in YYYY/MM/DD format
4. Supplier Number = WSCC Local number used to identify suppliers.
   Mapped using the plugin configuration, Koha vendor to supplier number as per Appendix A.
5. Contract Number = WSCC Local number used to identify supplier contracts.
   May be undefined, awaiting contracts list. Will be exposed in Plugin Configuration as an optional mapping for vendor to contract number.
6. Shipment Date = Shipment date for invoice in YYYY/MM/DD format

### Line Records (Field 1 populated, 2-6 empty, 7-15 populated)

**One line per unit received**

| Field Position | Field Name                            | Source                      | Sample Data                   | Comments                         |

#### Koha Field mappings

1. Invoice Number = Koha invoicenumber (Will match Header record for invoice)

7) Line Amount = Unit price
   _Question_: Should this amount be tax inclusive or tax exclusive

8. Tax Amount = Tax value on receipt
9. Tax Code = Mapped from 'Tax rate on receipt', 20% = 'STANDARD', 0% = 'ZERO', anything else = 'UNMAPPED'
10. Description = Mapped to 'Biblio title' unless there is no biblio attached, 'Library Materials' otherwise
11. Cost Centre = Mapped using an 'Additional Field' named 'Acquisitions Cost Centre' linked to the 'Branch' for the budget used with a configurable default, currently set to 'RN05'
12. Objective = Hard coded to 'ZZZ999', should be a configurable default and optionally a configurable mapping mapped to ?
13. Subjective = Hard coded to '503000', should be a configurable default and optionally a configurable mapping mapped to ?
14. Subanalysis = Mapped from 'Budget' using Plugin Configuration, configurable default currently set to '5460'
15. Line number = Running count of lines in the invoice indexed from '1'.

## Error handling, Archiving and Recovery

Oracle will send emails to the business when parsing errors are encountered.

No specific requirements at the Koha side for archival or audit trail.
